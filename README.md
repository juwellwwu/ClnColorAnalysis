# ClnColorAnalysis

This package includes custom MATLAB scripts for performing single clonal color analysis and clonal assignment of polyclonal populations as described in: 

Wu, J.W. et al. Defining Clonal Color in Fluorescent Multi-Clonal Tracking. Sci.Rep.6, 24303; doi: 10.1038/srep24303 (2016). 

The scripts were created in MATLAB R2011b and last revised on MATLAB R2014b, using a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 MacBookPro with 8Gb memory. This package also includes sample color data for running a demo and a copy of the DEMO output.
