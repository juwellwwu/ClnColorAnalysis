# ClnColorAnalysis

This package includes custom MATLAB scripts for performing single clonal color analysis and clonal assignment of polyclonal populations as described in Wu et al. “Defining Clonal Color in Fluorescent Multi-Clonal Tracking” (2015). The scripts were created in MATLAB R2011b and last revised on MATLAB R2014b, using a 2.6GHz Intel Core i7 MacBookPro with 8Gb memory. This package also includes sample color data for running a demo and a copy of the DEMO output.
